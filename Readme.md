# Fashion MNIST

My dream is to build an app that makes outfit recommendations based on my wardrobe. This is the first step.


The first step is recognizing and labeling items of clothing. The fashion MNIST data set (F_MNIST) includes 10 types of clothing which include: 
* T-shirt/top 
* Trouser
* Pullover
* Dress
* Coat
* Sandal
* Shirt
* Sneaker
* Bag
* Ankle boot
